### Background
**Definition of Tourism** \
Tourism involves traveling by individuals or groups to places outside their usual environment for leisure, business, or other purposes, typically for a temporary period. This activity includes both domestic and international travel, often involving accommodation, food, and entertainment at the destination.

**General Role of Tourism** \
Tourism plays a crucial role in the economy of many countries. Its general roles include:
1. **Source of Income:** Tourism is a major income source for many countries and regions. Tourists' spending on accommodation, food, transportation, and recreational activities significantly contributes to national and local income.
2. **Job Creation:** The tourism industry provides various types of employment, from hospitality and restaurants to transportation and tour services, helping to reduce unemployment and improve community welfare.
3. **Infrastructure Development:** Tourist demand often drives governments and private sectors to develop infrastructure such as airports, highways, and public facilities, benefiting local residents as well.
4. **Cultural Exchange:** Tourism opens opportunities for cultural exchange between tourists and locals, enhancing understanding and tolerance between different cultures.
   
**General Characteristics of Tourism** \
Tourism has several general characteristics:
1. **Temporality:** Tourism activities are temporary. Tourists usually stay at a destination for a certain period before returning to their place of origin.
2. **Heterogeneity and Complexity:** Tourism involves various activities such as nature tourism, cultural tourism, culinary tourism, and others. This diversity reflects the different interests and preferences of tourists.
3. **Perishable:** Tourism services are perishable; they cannot be stored for later consumption.
4. **Intangible:** Tourism experiences are intangible and subjective, depending on individual perceptions and satisfaction with the services and facilities received.

**Definition of Hotel** \
A hotel is an establishment providing accommodation in the form of rooms within a building, which may also offer food and beverage services, entertainment activities, and/or other facilities on a daily basis for profit.

**Hotel Classification** \
Hotels can be classified based on several criteria:
1. By Size: 
   - Large hotels: Over 300 rooms
   - Medium hotels: 100-299 rooms
   - Small hotels: 25-99 rooms
2. By Operation:
   - Year-round hotels: Operate all year
   - Seasonal hotels: Operate during certain seasons
3. By Location:
   - City Hotels: Located in urban areas
   - Residential Hotels: Located in suburban areas away from crowds
   - Resort Hotels: Located in tourist areas like mountains (mountain hotels) or beaches (beach hotels)
   - Motels: Located along highways connecting cities

### Dataset Overview
Online hotel reservation channels have transformed the booking process and influenced customer behavior. Customers can now easily book and cancel reservations, leading to increased cancellations and no-shows. Cancellations often occur due to changes in plans or scheduling conflicts, often driven by free or low-cost cancellation policies. To address this issue, hotels have begun implementing stricter cancellation policies and enhancing loyalty programs to ensure more secure reservations. Predicting which customers will cancel or not is also crucial for hotel management.

### Dashboards
